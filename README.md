# PyTorch Implementation of Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs)
The source code of NDDEs will be fully released once our extended work is published. If you have any question about this software, please contact Qunxi Zhu (qxzhu16@fudan.edu.cn).

## Examples
Examples can be found in the [`Examples`](./Examples) directory.

We encourage those who are interested in using the NDDEs framework to run the code [`Examples/Mackey_Glass/MGlass.py`](./Examples/Mackey_Glass/MGlass.py) for understanding how to use `NDDEs` to fit a typical 1-D delay system, i.e., Mackey Glass system.

Please run the following code in [`Examples/Mackey_Glass/MGlass.py`], the model checkpoints and the reconstruction figures are saved in the files  'model' and 'figures'.
```
python MGlass.py
```
One can use the following Colab link for this example.
